## 6) Detailed Code Breakdown
**6.1)** Let's start by importimg the necessary libraries
```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.dates as mdates
```
**6.2) Define Indices and Their Respective Currencies**

The `indices` dictionary defines various global financial indices and their respective trading currencies. This setup allows the program to fetch and process data for these indices accurately. Here is the dictionary:
```python
indices = {
    '^GSPC': 'USD',   # S&P 500 (USA)
    '^SPX': 'USD',    # S&P 500 (USA)
    '^IXIC': 'USD',   # NASDAQ Composite (USA)
    '^DJI': 'USD',    # Dow Jones Industrial Average (USA)
    'EEM': 'USD',     # iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (USA)
    'ACWI': 'USD',    # iShares MSCI ACWI ETF (USA)
    'IEF': 'USD',     # iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF (USA)
    'TLT': 'USD',     # iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (USA)
    '^GDAXI': 'EUR',  # DAX Performance Index (Germany)
    '^FCHI': 'EUR',   # CAC 40 Index (France)
    '000001.SS': 'CNY',  # Shanghai Composite Index (China)
    '^HSI': 'HKD',    # Hang Seng Index (Hong Kong)
    '^AXJO': 'AUD',   # S&P/ASX 200 Index (Australia)
    '^NSEI': 'INR',   # S&P NSE Sensex Index (India)
    '^GSPTSE': 'CAD',  # S&P/TSX Composite Index (Canada)
    '^STOXX50E': 'EUR', # EURO STOXX 50 Index (Europe)
    'DX-Y.NYB': 'USD', # US Dollar Index (USA)
    'DBC': 'USD',      # Invesco DB Commodity Tracking ETF (USA)
    '^FTSE': 'GBP',    # FTSE 100 Index (UK)
    '^N225': 'JPY',    # Nikkei 225 Index (Japan)
    '^SSMI': 'CHF',    # Swiss Market Index (Switzerland)
    'S68.SI': 'SGD',   # Singapore Exchange (Singapore Dollar)
}
```
**6.3) Define Weights for Each Index**

The `weights` dictionary assigns a specific weight to each index. These weights are used to calculate a weighted global index, ensuring that more significant indices have a proportionally larger impact on the overall index. Here is the dictionary:
```python
weights = {
    '^GSPC': 0.2849341505160153,
    '^SPX': 0.2849341505160153,
    '^IXIC': 0.13904406766236627,
    '^DJI': 0.06733580635221512,
    'EEM': 0.00013660798561437334,
    'ACWI': 0.00012873756669008846,
    'IEF': 5.5655105250300244e-05,
    'TLT': 7.770477096674917e-05,
    '^GDAXI': 0.009494473622946843,
    '^FCHI': 0.0162405469866196,
    '000001.SS': 0.04434918600192275,
    '^HSI': 0.016865183409181892,
    '^AXJO': 0.00974432819197176,
    '^NSEI': 0.019988365521993356,
    '^GSPTSE': 0.015615910564057308,
    '^STOXX50E': 0.029982548282990032,
    'DBC': 1.4366637718932724e-05,
    '^FTSE': 0.021862274789680232,
    '^N225': 0.02685936617017857,
    '^SSMI': 0.011868092028683554,
    'S68.SI': 0.00046847731692171925
}
```
These weights are determined based on the relative importance and market capitalization of each index, ensuring a balanced and representative global index.

## 7) Data Acquisition
**7.1) Fetching Adj Close Data**

This part of the code uses the `yfinance` library to fetch historical data for each index defined in the indices dictionary. The data is then stored in the `adj_close_data` dictionary for further processing.
```python
adj_close_data = {}

for index, timezone in indices.items():
    data = yf.download(index, period=period, interval=interval)
    data.dropna(how="any", inplace=True)
    
    if data.empty:
        print(f"No data for {index}")
        continue
    adj_close_data[index] = data['Adj Close']
```
The `period` and `interval` for fetching the data are obtained from user input, as shown in the code below.

```python
allowed_intervals = ['5m', '15m', '30m', '60m', '1d', '5d']
    interval_mapping = {
        '5m': ('5T', 50),
        '15m': ('15T', 25),
        '30m': ('30T', 25),
        '60m': ('60T', 20),
        '1d': ('1D', 15),
        '5d': ('5D', 10),
    }
    
    while True:
        interval = input(f"Enter the interval {allowed_intervals}: ")
        if interval not in allowed_intervals:
            print("Invalid interval. Please select from the allowed intervals.")
            continue
        
        period = input("Enter the period in days (e.g., '7d', '365d', '40d'): ")
        if not period.endswith('d') or not period[:-1].isdigit():
            print("Invalid period format. Please enter the period in days (e.g., '7d').")
            continue
        
        days = int(period.replace('d', ''))
        if days > 2000:
            print("The maximum number of days allowed is 2000. Please enter a valid period.")
            continue
```
The script prompts the user to enter a time interval and a period for fetching the data. The allowed intervals are `['5m', '15m', '30m', '60m', '1d', '5d']` representing different time frames (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 day, etc.)

The user is also asked to input the period, which defines how many days of historical data to retrieve (e.g., '7d' for 7 days). The script checks that the period is in the correct format and doesn't exceed 2000 days.

The script is configured with a maximum period of 2000 days, which is more than 5 years of data. However, it's important to note that for shorter intervals (like minutes), data availability is limited to a much shorter periodâ€”in this case, typically up to 60 days. These limitations apply specifically to minute-based intervals. For daily intervals, data can be retrieved for several years without issue. For more detailed information on these limitations, you can refer to the Yahoo Finance page.

The `interval_mapping` dictionary is a key part of the script that defines how different time intervals are handled. Each entry in the dictionary maps a user-selected interval (like '5m' for 5 minutes) to a tuple containing two important elements:

Frequency Code (e.g., '5T', '1D'):

The first element in each tuple is a frequency code that is used for time-based operations within the script.
The code is designed to be compatible with the pandas library's time-related functions, particularly when generating a range of times using `pd.date_range()`.

For example:
`5T` corresponds to a 5-minute frequency.
`1D` corresponds to a 1-day frequency.

This frequency code is used later in the script to create a time range that matches the selected interval, allowing the data to be properly aligned and processed according to the user's selection.

Smoothing Factor (e.g., 50, 25):

The second element in each tuple is a smoothing factor, which is used in calculations like the Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
The smoothing factor controls the sensitivity of the EMA to changes in data. A higher value results in more smoothing, meaning that the EMA will react more slowly to recent changes in data, while a lower value makes the EMA more responsive.

In this context:
For the `5m` interval, the smoothing factor is 50.
For the `1d` interval, the smoothing factor is 15.

This factor is later applied in the script when calculating the EMA to smooth out the data and highlight trends over the selected interval.

**7.1) Fetching Exchange Rate Data**

In this section of the code, we handle the currency exchange rates for indices that are traded in currencies other than USD. Since our goal is to create a global index that can be compared on a common basis, it is essential to account for these exchange rates. The exchange rates are stored in the `exchange_rates` dictionary.

```python
exchange_rates = {}

for index, currency in indices.items():
    if currency != 'USD':
        exchange_rate_data = yf.download(f'{currency}=X', period='2200d', interval='1d')
        
        if exchange_rate_data.empty:
            print(f"No data for {index}")
            continue
        exchange_rates[currency] = exchange_rate_data['Adj Close']
```
